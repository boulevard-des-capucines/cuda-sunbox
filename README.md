# CUDA sunbox

Here is my exercises which I do to get deeper into CUDA programming.


The tasks are taken in the book _"Programming in Parallel with CUDA: 
A Practical Guide"_ by **Richard Ansorge** (Cambridge University Press,
2022, https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108855273).

The headers in the directory **utils** are copied from the directory 
[include](https://github.com/RichardAns/CUDA-Programs/tree/main/include) 
of his [repo](https://github.com/RichardAns/CUDA-Programs) just for convenience 
when building.
